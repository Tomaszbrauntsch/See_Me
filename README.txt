1. Change the SerialPort ("/dev/cm.usbXXX") to the one the arduino is sending info to
2. run the node_connect.js via cd into directory then node node_connect.js
3. On browser type in URL http://localhost:3000/ (or other port number)
4. Distance Sensor Statistics appear in the terminal that has node active so basically the distances

[ ] Integrating Node into HTML (connecting the backend and frontend to obtain the file from back)
[ ] Integrating Sound to play when number / how far they are from item
